This project implements a MIPS processor on the Basys 3 FPGA using Vivado for hardware design and Vitis for software development. The setup involves designing the MIPS processor with peripherals in Vivado, generating a bitstream file, and then using Vitis to program a simple Hello World application. The project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software components on an embedded system.
